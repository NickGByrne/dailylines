    <img alt="May 1st 2023" src="img/2023may/dailylines05,01,23.png" style= "max-width:100%;height:auto;">
    <figcaption>  A portrait of my father Phill Byrne, seated around the dinner table after evening tea. The application sketch book glitched out on me while I was working and left me with a tiny work space and one colour to work with. These problems seemed to solve themselves the moment I finished pening the caption for this one, which is strange coincidence.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <figure>
      <h3 id="05,02,2023"> May 2nd 2023 </h3>
      <img alt="May 2nd 2023" src="img/2023may/dailylines05,02,23.png" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
      <figcaption> This one was done entirely using the pencil tool from the application sketchbook. I got a little tired of using the pencil tool for colouring so not all of this image was coloured in.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <figure>
      <h3 id="05,03,2023"> May 3rd 2023</h3>
      <img alt="May 3rd 2023" src="img/2023may/dailylines05,03,23.png" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
      <figcaption> Found a number of extra brushes hidden by a scroll down option on sketchbook, so I've added all of them to this sketch. They were mostly blended stroke brushes that blended previously made strokes and foreground strokes.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <figure>
      <h3 id = "05,04,2023"> May 4th 2023</h3>
      <img alt="May 4th 2023" src="img/2023may/dailylines05,04,23.png" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
      <figcaption> Starting sketches that use two types of brushes. building up to mixing all brushes eventually.I will keep making random science fiction and random fantasy settings until I start making ones that look professional, or at least that is the hope.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

      <h3 id="05,05,2023"> May 5th 2023 </h3>
      <img alt = "May 5th 2023" src="img/2023may/dailylines05,05,23.png" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
      <figcaption> This one got somewhat interrupted, hence the presence of only underline in this sketch.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <figure>
      <h3 id="05,06,2023"> May 6th 2023 </h3>
      <img alt = "May 6th 2023" src="img/2023may/dailylines05,06,23.png" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
      <figcaption> Going to be practising drawing tigers for a kids book a friend of mine Terisa Wong wants to produce. She has written a story about 3 baby tigers, and I have been given the task of illustrating this book.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <figure>
      <h3 id = "05,07,2023"> May 7th 2023</h3>
      <img alt = "May 7th 2023" src="img/2023may/dailylines05,07,23.png" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
      <figcaption> This tiger looks much better than the one I drew several months ago, although the next one will be drawn directly using reference.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <figure>
      <h3 id = "05,08,2023"> May 8th 2023</h3>
      <img alt = "May 8th 2023" src = "img/2023may/dailylines05,08,23.png" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
      <figcaption> These studies look good but some of the measures are off. you only notice when you try to map out the stripes on the tiger's face.</figcaption>

    </figure>
    
    <figure>
      <h3 id = "05,09,2023"> May 9th 2023</h3>
      <img alt = "May 9th 2023" src="img/2023may/dailylines05,09,23.png" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
      <figcaption> I tried to emulate a drawing style that I often see one of my friends perform, with a decent amount of success. This friend is a professional illustrator named Rocky who is working in the field. </figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <figure>
      <h3 id="05,10,2023"> May 10th 2023</h3>
      <img alt ="May 10th 2023" src="img/2023may/dailylines05,10,23.png" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
      <figcaption> Tigers are exceptionally hard to draw. The stripes especially outline every mistake that I have made in proportioning them when I draw them from life. I will also have to track the markings of the tiger characters in Terisa's story book, since every tiger has unique striping patterns on their face and body. </figcaption>
    </figure>

      <h3 id="05,11,2023"> May 11th 2023</h3>
      <img alt ="May 11th 2023" src="img/2023may/dailylines05,11,23.png" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
      <figcaption> I had to redraw the body. I'm not sure how but I ened up drawing a giant head and had to rescale the drawing to match the head. Drawing blues.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <figure>
      <h3 id="05,12,2023"> May 12th 2023</h3>
      <img alt = "May 12th 2023" src="img/2023may/dailylines05,12,23.png" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
      <figcaption> Sometimes it helps to draw a couple from memory to see what the progress is on my learning. </figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <figure>
      <h3 id="05,13,2023"> May 13th 2023</h3>
      <img alt = "May 13th 2023" src="img/2023may/dailylines05,13,23.png" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
      <figcaption> These quick memory tigers have a lot of quirks, but they have better form than the ones I made before I started doing photographic studies of tigers.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <figure>
      <h3 id="05,14,2023"> May 14th 2023</h3>
