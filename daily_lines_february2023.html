    <figcaption> This one was nearly a missile button being pressed on a nuclear submarine, however a control panel in a television broadcasting station works as well. And given the situation with Russia, a nuclear launch button might strike a little too close to current events.    </figcaption>

    <figcaption> No joke, this is actually a terrifying topic. I had an imagining that only the richest restaurants would be able to afford robot waiters, but the prospect of job replacement, (and what people will actually do for money after automation) is a serious issue.

    <figcaption> A little bit of philosophy for the reader. When I started these I was worried that no one would see or read these, but ever since I started posting some of these works to social media, and showing them to my family, that concern has been averted. I've even shown these pages to new acquaintances. </figcaption>

    <img alt="February 13th 2023" src="img/2023february/dailylines02,13,23.png">
    <figcaption> Inventing aliens again. I thought I was clever by giving the bug aliens mandibles, but looking at them again, I realise that they have a close resemblance to the bug aliens from Rick and Morty. I guess great minds think alike!</figcaption>

    <img alt="February 21st 2023" src="img/2023february/dailylines02,21,23.png">
    <figcaption> My pictures always turn out better when I make them with a process. The process for this picture was staring with basic shapes for the eyes and head. </figcaption>
  </figure>
  
  <figure>
    <h3 id = "02,22,2023"> February 22nd </h3>
    <img alt="February 22nd 2023" src="img/2023february/dailylines02,22,23.png">

    <img alt="February 24th 2023" src="img/2023february/dailylines02,24,23.png">

    <img alt="February 26th 2023" src="img/2023february/dailylines02,26,23.png">
    <figcaption> I have also finally found a drawing style that I truly enjoy on this medium. Even the rushed drawings turn out better when I let go of my attachment to strict human figures as a base drawing, and the output is more creative as well.I say this as I correct two days worth of lag in the drawing process, and need to draw things in this manner to keep motivated.</figcaption>

    <img alt="February 28th 2023" src="img/2023february/dailylines02,28,23.png">
    <figcaption> Forgot to draw my lines on an over layer again, and had to paint over top of drawings, but actually developed something that was starting to look good from it this time. If I spent more time with it I could make something with some real quality, But alas I need to sleep. </figcaption>
