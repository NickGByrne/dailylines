  <h2> Back on the horse again</h2>
  
  <p> So I took a break from daily lines to clean the house, lose my stylus, and join some game jam projects for a couple of weekends in the summer. But I am happy to say that (now that summer is drawing to a close, and summer term classes come to an end) I am back to drawing on my computer every day!</p>

  <figcaption> I tried to make a zany cartoon sketch and ended up drawing another robot. Go figure. Now to figure out why I took such a long break over the summer from these drawings. I think that I spent most of my time fretting over school work and worrying about my use of time instead of actually being more productive.</figcaption>
