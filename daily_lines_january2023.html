    <h1> EVERY DAY A LINE in January</h1>
    <h2 style="margin-left:50px;"> A line of code</h2>
    <h2 style="margin-left:150px;"> A line of drawing.</h2>
    
    <p>
    In the histories of Greece, Pliny the Elder recorded the phrase
    <q> Nulla Dies Sine Linea</q>
    or as it is translated in English
    <br><br>
    <q> No Day without line</q>
    <br><br>
    and it is in the spirit of this phrase that I pledge to make one drawing and one
    new line of code every day and to post the results of these on this websight.
