  for providing the training I needed to help build this website. For example, They taught me that the above links are <b>absolute URL's</b> whereas the links in the best of slides are relative URL's. The difference between them grammatically being that relative urls include the html tag and not the WWW.tag, while absolute URLS do include the www. tag and do not include the .html marker.</p>

  Oh how far we have come since the good old days.
  <br>
  When this project was so
  <br>
  inocent and so sweet
  <br>
  When I was still looking up how to code
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  In HTML
  <br>
  But now
  <br>
  I am much wiser
  <br>
  And maybe
  <br>
  By now,
  <br>
  A bit older
  <br>
  <br>
  And you have seen my journey written
  <br>
  <br>
  On this page
  <br>
  Some loved ones were lost
  <br>
  And I mourned for them
  <br>
  Some friends and prodjects started
  <br>
  And I rejoice in them.
  <br>
  But you were here for a part of it my firned
  <br>
  dear reader
  <br>
  Through my pitfalls,
  <br>
  Slow days
  <br>
  Artistic folloyes and
  <br>
  triumphs
  <br>
  For this page is an exersize
  <br>
  And not everything here is perfect.
  <br>
  But neither am I
  <br>
  and you also.
