  <figcaption> Playing around with digital painting techniques today. I find that digital paint is a lot like model painting, because the values of the paint colours are fairly absolute. I even used some similar techniques, such as under and over painting details and creases. Ran out of time to paint a background however, which has been somewhat hastily inserted. </figcaption>

 <figcaption> It occurs to me that many of the technological inventions will be similar across alien worlds. The same is true for certain forms of life. That said, I am not sure if this scene is a fantasy scene or an alien scene. Either way I have placed some fantasy plant life in the background of the scene.</figcaption>

 <figcaption> I've been playing a lot of old super mario games lately. It shows in my work. My drawing screen got stuck on a mode without layers and I decided to finish the drawing anyway. </figcaption>

 <figcaption> Some times the trick to drawing well is drawing well. In this case that means under drawing. I decided to combine my structured drawing style with the faces from the faces first drawing style I develpode in this series. The result is that I have rediscovered the drawing style I mastered in highschool. So much for progress, but I'll keep at it. </figcaption>

 <figcaption> I have found that drawing using the line of action in the spine first instead of using torso and head shapes leads to better drawings, not the least of the reasons being that I don't draw heads as ovals but as actual head shapes when I use this method of figure drawing.</figcaption>

 <figcaption> My sister left for home today after her visit. It was a shame to see her go but good to catch up with her. I'm not sure what my obsession with pirates is, but I think it will keep being a recurring theme.</figcaption>
