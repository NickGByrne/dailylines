    <figcaption>  Putting red in the background of portraits is somewhat of a habit of mine. I did the same thing for an illustration I did for the school newspaper on campus (The peak) one time..</figcaption>

    <img alt="March 5th 2023" src="img/2023march/dailylines03,05,23.png" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
    <figcaption> Inspired just a little bit by the suits in the movie Living (2023). I do however think that some sort of uniform would be a good policy for a multi species community like the fantasy folk I have portrayed here.</figcaption>

    <figcaption> The interrogation room is a ofcourse an easier background to draw, but I chose the background mostly because of this character's expression.</figcaption>

    <img alt = "March 7th 2023" src="img/2023march/dailylines03,07,23.png" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
    <figcation> I completed the drawing on time yesterday but forgot the coding! making this caption in advance of this submission.</figcation>

    <img alt ="March 8th 2023" src="img/2023march/dailylines03,08,23.png" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
    <figcatption> I guess I'm going through an abstract phase. This style, like all good art, is born out of necessity. I need to get these particular ones done before bed.</figcatption>

    <h3 id="03,09,2023"> March 9th 2023 </h3>
    <img alt = "March 9th 2023" src="img/2023march/dailylines03,09,23.png" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
    <figcaption> attempting to capture the effects of moonlight in this drawing. Needs more detail ofcourse. </figcaption>

    <h3 id="03,10,2023"> March 10th 2023 </h3>
    <img alt = "March 10th 2023" src="img/2023march/dailylines03,10,23.png" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
    <figcaption> So I took a longer hiatus than normal this week in order to get a prototyping project finished for class. Luckily I also had to work on a drawn storyboard for the class as well, so I have plenty of original artwork to fill in the gap. The sketches even managed to tide me over until March 25th (today's date) which is a strange coincidence, but a fortunate one.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  
  <figure>
    <h3 id="03,11,2023"> March 11th 2023 </h3>
    <img alt = "March 11th 2023" src="img/2023march/dailylines03,11,23.png" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
    <figcaption> This is one of two storyboards I ended up making, this one for the storyboard that made it into the project slides. The others were thrown on the cutting room floor, so it is good that they get to be preserved in this format, for whatever purpose that may show.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  
  
  <figure>
    <h3 id="03,12,2023"> March 12th 2023</h3>
    <img alt = "March 12th 2023" src="img/2023march/dailylines03,12,23.png" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
    <figcaption> I thought I would avoid using the marker brush to lead in this drawing, but fate has markers in mind for this month and week.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  
  <figure>
    <h3 id="03,13,2023"> March 13th 2023 </h3>
    <img alt = "March 13th 2023" src="img/2023march/dailylines03,13,23.png" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
    <figcaption> These storyboards are for an application we designed based on the Jamulus application. They were meant to be designed for the elderly, which is why elderly subjects play such a big role in these storyboard panels.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  
  <figure>
    <h3 id="03,14,2023"> March 14th 2023 </h3>
    <img alt = "March 14th 2023" src="img/2023march/dailylines03,14,23.png" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
    <figcaption> In these panels, an elderly musician sits at home, not having anyone to play her instrument with, which sits unused. She then gets introduced to our application sonnetto through a friend who plays an instrument. </figcaption>
  </figure>
  
  <figure>
    <h3 id="03,15,2023"> March 15th 2023 </h3>
    <img alt = "March 15th 2023" src="img/2023march/dailylines03,15,23.png" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
    <figcaption> Our hero of this story eventually finds people over the group and browsing sections of the application, and makes friends to jam with that they had not met before, setting up regular jamming sessions over the application.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  
  <figure>
    <h3 id="03,16,2023"> March 16th 2023 </h3>
    <img alt = "March 16th 2023" src="img/2023march/dailylines03,16,23.png" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
    <figcaption> Eventually our protagonist develops a regular group of friends, who they jam with on a regular basis. The final panel of this series shows a somewhat sad in retrospect image of the hero jamming alone in their apartment with no one actually around them. This is a bit of a reflection of the modern technological dilemma, but In reality, they would likely find a way to get their elderly friends to come over to their house to jam in person some way or another.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  
  <figure>
    <h3 id="03,17,2023"> March 17th 2023 </h3>
    <img alt = "March 17th 2023" src="img/2023march/dailylines03,17,23.png" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
    <figcaption> This series was actually done before the one that you saw previously. I uploaded them in the opposite order however. </figcaption>
  </figure>
  
  <figure>
    <h3 id="03,18,2023"> March 18th 2023 </h3>
    <img alt = "March 18th 2023" src="img/2023march/dailylines03,18,23.png" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
    <figcaption> This series or storyboard covers the use case for an application for elderly people with altziemer’s, and was an application designed specifically to provide music therapy to dementia patients by playing music from their youth to them. This entire concept was based on two scientific papers we discovered describing a particular type of music therapy where music from a patient’s early life was played to them specifically to stimulate their memories.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  
  <figure>
    <h3 id="03,19,2023"> March 19th 2023 </h3>
    <img alt = "March 19th 2023" src="img/2023march/dailylines03,19,23.png" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
    <figcaption> Although our idea was backed by research, our classes TA ended up telling us to ditch the idea, specifically because of the difficulties we would eventually have to face looking for patients with alhiemer's and dementia to test our application on. </figcaption>
  </figure>
  
  <figure>
    <h3 id="03,20,2023"> March 20th 2023 </h3>
    <img alt = "March 20th 2023" src="img/2023march/dailylines03,20,23.png" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
    <figcaption> In this storyboard, our hero sits at home with their adult daughter and caregiver, not being able to communicate with her properly due to their condition. Eventually, their daughter finds out that playing childhood music can help stimulate the memories of dementia patients, and downloads the application for her father. </figcaption>
  </figure>
  
  <figure>
    <h3 id="03,21,2023"> March 21 th 2023 </h3>
    <img alt = "March 21 th 2023" src="img/2023march/dailylines03,21,23.png" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
    <figcaption> One theme that you might notice in this series is how often the daughter of the protagonist has to do things for them in the process of downloading and using the application. This became a theme because of the particular concerns of my team mate, who interviewed a caretaker for a person with alziemer’s, and reported that they had to do just about everything for their parent before they eventually passed away. despite this, my team mate insisted that I show our protagonist enjoying music independently in their home, since our application was supposed to make independent use possible for this extreme use case.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  
  <figure>
    <h3 id="03,22,2023"> March 22th 2023 </h3>
    <img alt = "March 22th 2023" src="img/2023march/dailylines03,22,23.png" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
    <figcaption> I remember being particularly proud of this series of drawings, I was even convinced that my daily drawings had increased my drawing abilities, and that this was reflected in my drawings. Looking back at them now, I see that they are at about the level of some of my better work from highschool, and get a little bit disappointed, but only because of how much I looked up to them when I made them.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  
  <figure>
    <h3 id="03,23,2023"> March 23th 2023 </h3>
    <img alt = "March 23th 2023" src="img/2023march/dailylines03,23,23.png" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
    <figcaption> I was particularly happy with my use of underdrawings for this series, and the three dimensional form that they gave to the shape of its subjects faces. I also struggled with making realistic hands, which I modelled for myself for reference. For the later series, I did sketching in a much looser manner, and reverted back to a style closer to the one I use for my daily sketches.(fast lines and basic shapes instead of measured guidelines.) </figcaption>
  </figure>
  
  <figure>
    <h3 id="03,24,2023"> March 24th 2023 </h3>
    <img alt = "March 24th 2023" src="img/2023march/dailylines03,24,23.png" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
    <figcaption> And that catches me up to one day before the current date (March 25th) . I must say that it was weird not doing the daily drawing activity for an extended period of time, and I actually got quite bored without it. I sort of replaced it with daily jogging, but it relay is not the same. I am happy to be back at the work table, and look forward to making more work more regularly! </figcaption>
    </figure>
    
     <figure>
      <h3 id="03,25,2023"> March 25th 2023</h3>
      <img alt = "March 25th 2023" src="img/2023march/dailylines03,25,23.png" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
      <figcaption> It feels good to be back at the craft. This one is not too dissimilar from my standard drawing type. Still you can see the difference in quality between when I draw faces first versus when I follow my normal style (heads and bodies first) and my learnt style still looks much better then what I have been trying out in these last number of drawings.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <figure>
      <h3 id="03,26,2023"> March 26th 2023</h3>
      <img alt = "March 26th 2023" src="img/2023march/dailylines03,26,23.png" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
      <figcaption> This practice comes with a creative kick that is something like magic, so I feel somewhat for the young dwarf sorceress in this sketch. Will be changing up my style to come up with more work I can be happy with. Took pictures of the spider sculpture under victoria street bridge with my father and went out to hons afterwards for wonton soup, so it was a good day. </figcaption>
      </figure>
      
    <figure>
    <h3 id="03,27,2023"> March 27th 2023</h3>
    <img alt = "March 27th 2023" src="img/2023march/dailylines03,27,23.png" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
    <figcaption> Not sure if puffy hats will ever be a real fashion trend. However they are a fun shape to draw, so I would give them a chance. </figcaption>
    
    </figure>
    
    <figure>
      <h3 id="03,28,2023"> March 28th 2023</h3>
      <img alt = "March 28th 2023" src="img/2023march/dailylines03,28,23.png" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
      <figcaption>  A good show was on at the pendulum gallery today. One artist made replica old fashioned black and white family portrait photographs, very impressive use of mise en scene.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <figure>
      <h3 id="03,29,2023"> March 29th 2023</h3>
      <img alt = "March 29th 2023" src="img/2023march/dailylines03,29,23.png" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
          <figcaption> I reused the guards from one of my earlier drawings. This means that I need to hit the history books and expand my repertoire of men in armour.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <figure>
      <h3 id="03,30,2023"> March 30th 2023</h3>
      <img alt = "March 30th 2023" src="img/2023march/dailylines03,30,23.png" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
      <figcaption> Did steady work on my protopie project for my team and managed to get out to do photography today. Altogether things went quite well.</figcaption>

    </figure>
    
    <figure>
      <h3 id = "03,31,2023"> March 31st 2023</h3>
      <img alt = "March 31st 2023" src="img/2023march/dailylines03,31,23.png" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
      <figcaption> This armour comes from a documentary I watched called "the last knight" this armour worn by a well renowned duelist. The boiler plate face mask on the minimalist helmet was quite intimidating.</figcaption>
