    <h2 style="background-color:tomato;"> A line of drawing, a line of code</h2>
    
        <p>
      On this website, I will test my ability to <b>draw</b> and <i>code</i> <strong>every day</strong>. They say that Rome was not built in a day, and that <mark>every journey of a thousand steps starts with the first foot forward,</mark> and it is in that spirit that I write this website and start this project.
        <br>
        <br>
        <ins>The name of this website however comes from a quote from Leonardo Davinci who said</ins>
        <br>
        <q>NO DAY WITHOUT LINE</q>.
        <br>
    </p>
        <pre>
          In this case however,
              CODE as well as art is practised in this manner,
                the goal being to review and to practise material I have been studying at
                SFU's interactive arts program.

I am either putting the eyes too close together for proper head proportions, or I am simply not willing to make busts, and shrink the bodies to make room for expressive bodies.
