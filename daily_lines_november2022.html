   <p>
    The rules for this page are simple. Every day One drawing, One line of code, and one line
    of writing. This is also somewhat of a diary, so every day, a recrimination or piece of autobiography (potentially). In doing so, I hope to forever put away the sensation that I am somehow wasting time by not doing art, and also perfect my mastery of html coding (also CSS), all while gushing about my personal inner state and thoughts.

    <figcaption> Alien world colours are difficult to blend in a manner that is appealing to our mere human perceptions, but I managed to get the effects of atmosphere correct in this - colours chosen at random. The green sky gives me particular appreciation for the shading qualities of our own brilliant blue sky and blue ocean, although most skylines are probably clear like the moon, or red brown like mars on alien worlds.

    <figcaption>  The minimum size of the marker brush used in googles sketch pad application actually got in the way of completing this one to my liking (specifically around the eyes). A second run this month at digital paint renders better results then the previous attempt. Finding a setting for one typical ethnographic fantasy painting was a lot of fun, and I like the techno nomad back story.  </figcaption>

    <figcaption> I had a theory after my initial digital paintings that you could define an entire protrait with nothing but a single highlingt color, a single shadow color, and a single body color, and that you could define this simple scema for every shade in a multi color digital painting. I seem to have been correct in this thought. </figcaption>

    <figcaption> The goal for this one was to utilise the facial expression driven style recommended by the animatorâ€™s survival guide and draw base faces that would drive a drawing of a character rather than starting from a bodily gesture. All the rules I had made about digital paint went straight out the window as I ran out of time to finish the paint for this one. At any rate, we are back to doing digital sketches. I am finding good use for the opacity options in painting the car interior however.</figcaption>

  <figcaption> With the wonders of technology it is dificult to tell that this image was made entirely using digital paint. The previous painting has taught me the valuable leason of using non - standard bruch heads for digital painting. The theme for this one - prince of persia in a Dungeons and Dragons random fantasy setting, chosen at randome after starting with a made up boduly pose.</figcaption>

    <figcaption> A second facial study. Sometimes I wonder if something is lost when I paint over and stencil  my virtual pencil lines, and I wonder if I am better off leaving them as pencil sketches. But then I remember that I need to teach myself how to use digital paints, not drawing.</figcaption>

    <figcaption> So I discovered the layers function in google chrome canvas just a little too late. After I had already started painting over my line work! needless to say, layers are used in this drawing,specifically shading and line cleanup layers were added, but that layers were not used in the traditional manner (with colour and line layers being the tradition.)</figcaption>

      <figcaption> So I finally figured out how to use layers in the correct manner in google chrome canvas and my painting suddenly becomes lazy as all heck (although you can't tell from the image). but you can finally see the original pencil work that I obliterated in my former Facial expression driven drawing studies. For those paying attention, this is number four in that series of exercises, but I will probably stop counting after this one. I've figured out that these studies are another form of doodling, which simply starts with the smallest possible base shape, as opposed to the larger ovals I typically use as a basis for my figure and gesture based sketches as a jumping off point.(drawing driven by the eyes instead of the shape of the head and chest.) </figcaption>

      <figcaption> I have been trying to find a happy medium between the indeterminate pastel like marks left by the mock paint texture in google canvas, and the harsh but appealing colour left by the marker tool in canvas (the more traditional computer paint tool).and think that I have finally found a happy medium while panning this pastoral kid's adventure picture. Painting solid colours underneath white filled pastel marks!  </figcaption>

      <figcaption> This is also a face study. I have decided to take it easy on a couple of these in order to keep having fun with them. Something about the digital medium is slightly less frictionless then pen and paper, but I can't put my finger on why. Probably my own fears of breaking the machine every time I scribe on it.</figcaption>
