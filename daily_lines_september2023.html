    <figcaption> The beginning of this month's drawing marks the end of my summer vacation. I will be returning to town tomorrow to the city of vancouver.</figcaption>

    <img alt="September 3rd 2023" src="img/2023september/dailylines09,03,23.png">
    <figcaption> Was drawing fantasy characters so I thought I would add fantasy buildings in the background. The buildings are not the best drawn but I put golden tops on the office towers. </figcaption>

    <img alt="September 4th 2023" src="img/2023september/dailylines09,04,23.png">
    <figcaption> This one is pretty low effort, what more can I say. </figcaption>

    <img alt="September 5th 2023" src="img/2023september/dailylines09,05,23.png">
    <figcaption> I was inspired by an artist process video I saw in making this where the artist made their work in three layers, an underdrawing layer, a sketch layer, and a paint layer. It did not turn out quite as I hoped (and I ran out of time to finish it) but I will try again later. </figcaption>

    <h3 id = "09,06,2023"> September 6th 2023</h3>
    <img alt="September 6th 2023" src="img/2023september/dailylines09,06,23.png">
    <figcaption> I have decided to not fret these drawings so much over the next couple of months, as I have to focus on school. </figcaption>

    <h3 id = "09,07,2023"> September 7th 2023</h3>
    <img alt="September 7th 2023" src="img/2023september/dailylines09,07,23.png">
    <figcaption> I could not be bothered to do under drawing today so I am back to trying out the faces first style I developed during this series. Still throws some very good results sometimes so I am not going to knock it. Also not an excuse. </figcaption>

    <img alt="September 8th 2023" src="img/2023september/dailylines09,08,23.png">
    <figcaption>  I Got sick today with the flu and missed a social event for my faculty. You think that would mean more time to draw but I spent most of the day in bed sick. </figcaption>

    <img alt="September 9th 2023" src="img/2023september/dailylines09,09,23.png">
    <figcaption> This one did not turn out. I rushed it but the starting pose is also wrong. Where did I go wrong? </figcaption>
  </figure>
  
  <figure>
    <h3 id = "09,10,2023"> September 10th 2023</h3>
    <img alt="September 10th 2023" src="img/2023september/dailylines09,10,23.png">
    <figcaption> I'm starting to notice precisely when and where I get lazy as an artist, which I think is a good sign for my development as an artist. Next time I will add more detail to my background as I notice that it needs it, which is what I noticed myself missing in this particular drawing. </figcaption>

    <img alt="September 11th 2023" src="img/2023september/dailylines09,11,23.png">
    <figcaption> Again too simple but atleast I innovated with how I used backgrounds in this composition(drawing through the body of the foreground image instead of just creating a colour and line layer.)  </figcaption>

    <figcaption> Was going for something like a pokemon. It did not quite turn out but atleast it is different than usual!  </figcaption>

    <img alt="September 14th 2023" src="img/2023september/dailylines09,14,23.png">
    <figcaption> This use of the faces first method really turned out (even though the eyes are too big) I might do a series like this for the next couple of days.  </figcaption>
  </figure>
  
  <figure>
    <h3 id = "09,15,2023"> September 15th 2023</h3>
    <img alt="September 15th 2023" src="img/2023september/dailylines09,15,23.png">
    <figcaption>  Apparently I am better at drawing lions than I am at drawing tigers. Then again. Tigers have there stipes which make them difficult to draw. </figcaption>

    <h3 id = "09,16,2023"> September 16th 2023</h3>
    <img alt="September 16th 2023" src="img/2023september/dailylines09,16,23.png">
    <figcaption> After a month of life drawing tigers from photographs this is the tiger I am able to draw from memory alone. It is at least better than when I started.

    <img alt="September 17th 2023" src="img/2023september/dailylines09,17,23.png">
    <figcaption> Tried to do a direct paint and layering sketch. Did not quite work out. also ran out of time to fill in the background.
   </figcaption>

    <img alt="September 18th 2023" src="img/2023september/dailylines09,18,23.png">
    <figcaption> Started my first day of a stilt walking workshop! This sketch is one of my first successes with drawing tigers from memory. The trick has been doing under shapes for the snout and body.
